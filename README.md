# Carstore Project-

 

**Project Overview:**
The "Car Buying Application" is a comprehensive software solution designed to streamline the process of purchasing a car, managing payments, and calculating Equated Monthly Installments (EMIs). This project aims to provide a user-friendly platform that allows customers to browse and select their preferred cars, make payments securely, and calculate EMIs.
1. **User Authentication:** The primary objective of the project is to implement a secure user authentication system that allows individuals to register, log in, and maintain their personal profiles. This ensures that only authorized users can access the system.
2. **Car Selection:** The project facilitates the selection of cars from a diverse inventory. Users can browse through various car models, view their specifications, and make selections based on their preferences.
3. **Payment Processing:** It provides a seamless payment processing system where users can make payments using different payment methods. All payment data is securely stored for reference.
4. **EMI Calculation:** The project includes an EMI calculator that allows users to determine their monthly installment amount based on factors such as loan amount, interest rate, and tenure.
5. **Data Storage:** All user actions, including car selections and payments, are recorded and stored in a SQL Server database, ensuring data integrity and enabling retrieval for future reference.
